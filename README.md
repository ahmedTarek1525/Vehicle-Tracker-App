Vehicle Tracker App

The Vehicle Tracker App allows users to keep track of their owned vehicles. Whether it’s a sleek sports car or a trusty family minivan, this app has you covered. Let’s dive into the details:

Features:

1- Add New Vehicles:

At the top of the page, users will find a form.
Enter the name of the vehicle (e.g., “Subaru”) and its value (in dollars or your preferred currency).
Click “Submit” to add the vehicle to the list.

2- Vehicle List:

Below the form, the app displays a list of owned vehicles.
Each vehicle shows its name and value.
Users can delete any vehicle they’ve added.

3- Search Functionality:
To make finding specific vehicles easier, we’ve added a search input.
Type in a search term (e.g., “F-O-R”) to filter the list.
The app will temporarily hide vehicles that don’t match the search term.
The total value will adjust accordingly.

4- Total Value Calculation:

The app keeps track of the total value of all visible vehicles.
As you search or delete vehicles, the total value dynamically updates.

5-Handling Identical Names:

If users add vehicles with identical names (e.g., two “Ford Focus” cars), the app will highlight this for clarity.
